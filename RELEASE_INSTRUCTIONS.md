### While preparing a release:

- [ ] Create a "release candidate" branch (i.e. rc/0.16.2), and push to main fork (https://github.com/AllenInstitute/AllenSDK)
- [ ] Create a draft pull request for the release (i.e. Release Candidate 0.16.2)
  - [ ] Assign a developer to be responsible for the release deployment
  - [ ] Add the Project Owner as a reviewer
  - [ ] Copy this checklist into the draft pull request description

### After each major change to master:

- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md: https://github.com/AllenInstitute/AllenSDK/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Update "what's new" section of index.rst, if needed
- [ ] Rebase the release candidate branch, and force-push to the main fork

### When you are ready to release:

- [ ] Prepare the official release commit
  - [ ] Bump version by updating __version__ in __init__.py
  - [ ] Add the release date to the CHANGELOG.md and index.rst files
  - [ ] Change the draft to pull request to "ready for review"
  - [ ] Code Review with the Project Owner
  - [ ] Merge when it is ready; this will generate a merge commit, and this commit will be the official release commit.
- [ ] Confirm that this official release commit passes all continuous integration:
